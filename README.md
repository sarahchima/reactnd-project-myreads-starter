# MyReads Project

This is application enables a user to categorize books into three shelves:
- Currently Reading
- Want to Read
- Read

Each book has a control that lets you select the shelf for that book. When you select a different shelf, the book moves there. 

The main page has a link to the search page. The search page enables users to search for and add new books to a shelf.

1. Clone or download the project
